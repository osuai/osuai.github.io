    <h3 class="mt-2">Welcome to OSU Artificial Intelligence Club!</h3>
    <p>
        The Artificial Intelligence Club is a student run organization that meets regularly 
        to discuss topics and work on projects in Artificial Intelligence, Machine 
        Learning, and Deep Learning. OSU Artificial Intelligence Club mainly consists of 
        students in the EECS program, however, all are welcome to join who have a passion 
        for learning about Artificial Intelligence. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-2">What We Do</h3>
    <p>
        The members of the club believe that Artificial Intelligence is a large 
        player in science and will shape society as a whole. The members 
        would like to encourage those interested in exploring Artificial Intelligence to check 
        out the club and see if Artificial Intelligence fits their interests. The club is actively 
        seeking students who would like to learn or develop projects. The club aims to build 
        applications that demonstrate the capabilities of current Artificial Intelligence
        technologies. Eventually the club hopes to use these applications in real world 
        settings and in fun demonstrations.
